# Admin Dashboard

**Project Overview**

This Admin Dashboard project is built as part of The Odin Project’s Intermediate HTML and CSS module. The goal is to design and implement a fully featured dashboard layout using modern CSS Grid techniques. The dashboard mimics a professional admin interface, including a sidebar for navigation, a header area, and a main content section with cards, announcements, and trending topics.

**Features**

- Sidebar navigation with distinct branding and links
- Header featuring search, user info, and quick actions
- Main content area organized into projects, announcements, and trending sections
- Use of CSS Grid for layout and nested grids for component organization
- Customizable design: fonts, icons, and color themes
- Responsive design (optional, for advanced practice)

**Tech Stack**

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Grid, Flexbox, modern properties)
- Optionally: SVG icons from Material Design Icons
- Google Fonts for typography

**Project Objectives**

- Practice real-world layout skills with CSS Grid and nesting
- Structure HTML for scalable, maintainable interfaces
- Experiment with custom styling, assets, and responsive behaviors
